# Journalism

In addition to building some of the core data infrastructure that powered [FiveThirtyEight's](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) political coverage, I've worked on a variety of journalistic projects that were computational in nature -- including [pollster ratings](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/), newsroom-wide [data investigations](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/uber/), and various election forecasts -- during my time at the site. I made an [election-night bot](https://twitter.com/FiveyFox/status/1323854355708186624) which reported election results onto FiveThirtyEight's live blog and have helped build interactive visualizations. 

In addition to the computational work, I also was a [regular writer](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/dhrumil-mehta/) on topics including politics, elections and media. I pitched and starred in a [Polling 101 explainer series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TambSayfCOE&t=85s) as "Professor Polls", a geeky but fun YouTube professor who helps a lay audience better understand how public opinion polling. That was before I was a real professor. I also brefily served as the site's interim quantitative editor. 

In addition to writing and coding, my portfolio includes appearances on TV and radio broadcasts for networks including [BBC](https://archive.org/details/BBCNEWS_20190927_200000_World_News_Today/start/1014/end/1074?q=dhrumil+mehta), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/28/928556186/whats-changed-since-polls-were-wrong-about-2016s-presidential-election) and [Cheddar](https://cheddar.com/media/trumps-family-separation-policy-isnt-polling-well). I have also written data-driven pieces on issues pertaining to the South Asian American diaspora for [The Juggernaut](https://www.thejuggernaut.com/author/dhrumil-mehta).
