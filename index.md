# Dhrumil Mehta

I'm a _Database Journalist_ at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/dhrumil-mehta/). I collect, analyze, and write about data mostly pertaining to US politics.


I am also an _Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy_ and a _Democracy and Technology Fellow_ at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/dhrumil-mehta) where I recently developed and taught [Programming and Data for Policymakers](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/courses/programming-and-data-policymakers), a course designed to equip policy students with the skills needed to navigate nuanced issues at the interscection of technology and governance through a combination of hands-on programming workshops and policy discussions. I have a research interest in artificial intelligence, particularly using computational analysis of language to better understand political environments.
