# Dhrumil Mehta

Hello! I'm an _Associate Professor of Journalism_ at [Columbia University](https://journalism.columbia.edu/) where I teach classes focused on data. I'm also _Assistant Director_ of the [Tow Center for Digital Journalism](https://towcenter.columbia.edu/).

I previously worked as a _Database Journalist_ at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/dhrumil-mehta/), where I built and maintained the site's database of public opinion polls, its open data repositories and other core infrastructure. In addition to making scrapers, bots, databases and interactive graphics, I also reported on and wrote about elections, public opinion and media. 

I am also an _Visiting Associate Professor of Public Policy_ at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/dhrumil-mehta) where I teach a course that I developed called [Programming and Data for Policymakers](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/courses/programming-and-data-policymakers). The class is designed to equip policy students with the skills needed to navigate nuanced issues at the intersection of technology and governance through a combination of hands-on programming workshops and policy discussions.
